### Responsiveness tests

The responsiveness tests were mainly composed of device, viewport, browser and compatability tests. The deployed Filmfeed DRF API has underwent rigorous and frequent testing on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure its responsiveness and adaptability. Developer Tools were utilized to simulate various screen sizes, enabling thorough examination of how the website behaves across different devices. The API was also tested on different web browsers, in tandem with it's frontend half to ensure that there were no errors or issues being caused between them. Due to the nature of the API being mainly backend, these tests were more focused on performance and functionality.
