### Responsiveness tests

The responsiveness tests were mainly composed of device, viewport, browser and compatability tests. The deployed filmfeed react application has underwent rigorous and frequent testing on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure its responsiveness and adaptability. Developer Tools were utilized to simulate various screen sizes, enabling thorough examination of how the website behaves across different devices. The frontend was also tested on different web browsers, in tandem with it's backend half to ensure that there were no errors or issues being caused between them.
