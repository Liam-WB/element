# Filmfeed

"Filmfeed" is a movie enthuasiast's take on a social media website, made for all types of users who are interested in sharing their experience and journey. Whether you're a casual watcher or a critic, filmfeed is tailor-made to welcome all, new-face or old to create connections and meet like-minded watchers!

This README.md is for the project frontend. For more information on the project backend, please visit [this link](https://github.com/Liam-WB/filmfeed-api).

The filmfeed interactive frontend is designed to give users a digitally hassle free and relatively simple yet effective user experience by keeping their journey to their intended actions short and sweet, whilst not taking their attention away from the big picture. Everything from asset performance to colour palet have been made with UX in mind. Unregistered users will be greeted with a hub-like-homepage connecting different movie enthusiasts, or people that just want to connect, from around the world, keeping up to date with the latest watches or simply joining in conversations. Unregistered users will find the usual social media features: Sign in/ Sign up pages, posts with the latest movie likes, dislikes, conversations, most popular movies and profiles and their pages as well as search functionality for finding more specific comments, posts or profiles. For those looking to get involved, signed in users will be given access to their own profile/identity as well as a tailor made experience for them to start their own conversations, topics or join other conversations. Users will also be able to like/unlike others posts and follow/unfollow others, therefore updating their own likes/dislikes and feeds.

## User Experience Design (UX)

### Strategy

#### Project Objective

The overall desired outcome of this project is to create and develop a content sharing, hub-like web application open to a wide demographic, ranging from casual modern day media consumers to professional movie critics. With this in mind, the site is made to provoke and inspire conversations on movie related topics, whilst consuming backend API data which is where all of the user's data will be stored, to boost performance as well as secure their sensitive information. To reach this outcome, the user is provided with view, created, edit, delete functionality, all with a twist of movie implementation, to provide the user with the best possible UX. The content is placed logically throughout the website, so that users can find what they need, without issue, and so that they can manage their own data as intended. With this in mind, these features are intended to allow users to interact with one another, hassle free and with all the above objectives considered.

#### Agile project management

This project was designed, developed and manages with agile methodologies in mind to provide the developer with an efficient and effective development process. This was done by delivering small features to the project step by step, allowing for easier project management, organisation and allowing each component to be given the detail and attention that is required. I started by creating a kanban board, developed in github projects and used this as the main project management, and organisation to help visualise the project priorities, limit in progress, and maximise the work flow/efficiency to make the frontend development process simpler. The user stories were colour coded with green, yellow, purple, red to categorise functions depending on priority and work progress.

I began by creating epics, divided into 3 sections. First I created the workspace epic, which would essentially house all of the projects task. After this I began developing desired user stories that would fit into the other 2 epics: Frontend resources, or backend API resources. I then began adding all of the frontend resources first as these were the desired outcome I was looking to give, and therefore the most valuable to consider during the project inception. Next, I turned my attention to developer user stories: What I as a developer was looking to achieve with these user stories in mind, and how I wanted to store these components. As mentioned above, after doing this the tasks were then colour coded and the projects planning became more fleshed out as I continued to develop components, step by step.
